# Attendance Tracker

This simple web app tracks employee attendance. It now includes a basic authentication system. Users can register with a username, password and additional profile information which are stored in `localStorage`. A hard coded admin account (`admin` / `adminpass`) is available. After logging in, employees only see and add their own records while the admin can view everything and delete entries.

## Registration Fields

When signing up a new employee account the following details are collected:

- **Username**
- **Password**
- **Address**
- **English Proficiency** (Beginner, Intermediate or Advanced)
- **Hobby**

Open `attendance.html` in a browser to use the tracker.
