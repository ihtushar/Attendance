# Attendance Tracker

This simple web app tracks employee attendance. It now includes a basic authentication system. Users can register with a username and password which are stored in `localStorage`. A hard coded admin account (`admin` / `adminpass`) is available. After logging in, employees only see and add their own records while the admin can view everything and delete entries.

Open `attendance.html` in a browser to use the tracker.
